A cat (English: cat) usually refers to a domestic cat (scientific name: Felis catus, English: domestic/house cat), which is a small domestic carnivorous mammal and belongs to the small feline family. According to genetic and archaeological analyses, the record of humans keeping cats can be traced back to the Fertile Crescent region 10,000 years ago. The record of ancient Egyptians raising cats to prevent rats from stealing grains can be traced back to before 1000 BC.


Nowadays, cats have become one of the most widely kept pets in the world, with a keeping rate second only to dogs. They can treat low moods and provide emotional value, etc. Cats that are kept indoors for a long time tend to be healthier on average, with a lifespan of over 12 years. The oldest cat in history lived to be 38 years old. As a result, in some cities, the number of households choosing to keep cats has exceeded that of dogs. However, at the same time, cats are predators. A large number of cats, due to being abandoned and exposed to the external environment, not only cause the spread of epidemics in poor hygiene but also lead to urban management problems. Secondly, these cats threaten the survival of birds and rodents.
